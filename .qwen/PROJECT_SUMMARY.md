# Project Summary

## Overall Goal

The user is working on a Next.js monorepo optimization project, specifically refactoring code to improve the monorepo structure and modularize features into reusable components and shared packages.

## Key Knowledge

- Project is hosted in `/Users/henry_lee/Developer/Personal/my-website`
- Uses pnpm as the package manager with a workspace configuration
- Utilizes Turbo for build system
- Contains multiple apps in `apps/` directory, primarily `my-website`
- Has shared packages in `packages/` directory
- Currently on branch `refctor/monorepo-optimization`
- Technology stack includes React, Next.js, TypeScript
- Multiple features being refactored: AI Analyzer, Blog, Resume, Time Tracker
- The user mentioned interest in using ChromeDevTools MCP for debugging, but this was clarified as not being directly possible with the current agent capabilities

## Recent Actions

- Made significant changes across the codebase as shown in git status
- Modified components across multiple features (AI Analyzer, Blog, Resume, Time Tracker)
- Updated shared packages with new components, constants, and types
- Added new files for type definitions and constants in packages/shared
- Modified various configuration files including tsconfig.json and pnpm-lock.yaml
- Created new scripts for article parsing and synchronization
- The agent analyzed the ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp repository, explaining what it is and how it works
- Agent acknowledged limitations in directly connecting to or controlling external services like MCP

## Current Plan

- [DONE] Analyze current git status and show changes in the monorepo
- [DONE] Explain limitations regarding ChromeDevTools MCP integration
- [TODO] Continue with the monorepo optimization work
- [TODO] Review and potentially refactor current changes for better modularity
- [TODO] Ensure all components are properly organized in shared packages where appropriate
- [TODO] Test the application after changes to ensure everything works correctly
